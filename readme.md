:warning: This repository is still in its early stages. I am working on adding more exercises but I would appreciate your help. Please refer to the [contributing](#contributing) section.

# Introduction
This repository contains several exercises to get started with JavaScript.

Each exercise consists of a basic tasks for beginners, advanced tasks for people who already feel more comfortable and sometimes a little extra.

Every exercise folder has a readme file containing the exercise description, the different tasks and sometimes a hint. The hint will be struck through so you don't read it on accident if you don't want to. :wink:

# Setup
To get started with an exercise click on the corresponding subfolder and read the readme file.

If you want you can use the [base](./base) folder as your base. This contains basic code that you can use to get started quickly.

Copy the base folder or create your own html file and open it in your browser.

Start coding! :smiley:

# Exercises
1. [Counter](./counter)
2. [Unit Converter](./unit-converter)

# Contributing
## Your help is appreciated
In order to be useful this repository needs a lot more exercises. If you have some spare time and want to contribute your own exercises I would be very glad to recieve a pull request from you.

## How to contribute
### Ideas

You can then discuss it there and if you do not want to implement it someone else will do it eventually.

## What to include
Please make sure to describe the exercise extensively in your readme file.

The idea is to have a basics part for absolute beginners and an advanced part for people who feel more comfortable. The advanced part should actually be a little tricky. A beginner should not be able to do it with ease.

Don't worry if you can only implement one of those parts. It is still very helpful and can be interesting to everybody.

If you want to change something on the base (e.g. the readme, the basic idea) feel free to do so. Just mention it in the pull request and also say why you want do to that change.

## Template
Take the [counter](./counter) exercise as an example and use the [readme.template.md](./contributing/readme.template.md) in the [contributing](./contributing) folder as a template for your exercise readme.
