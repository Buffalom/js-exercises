# Fibonacci
## Basic
### Description
The goal of this exercise is to visualize the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

We will be adding a \<p>-tag for every number in the sequence to list all the numbers.

### Tasks
1. First make a function that accepts a number as a parameter and adds a \<p>-tag to the bottom of the body. The number should of course be the content of the \<p>-tag.
2. Then code the feature that calls the previously made function for every number of the sequence.
3. Make sure to add a condition that stops you from going beyond a certain number.
4. If you have not done that yet, try to implement the same thing using [recursive function calling](https://medium.com/@zfrisch/understanding-recursion-in-javascript-992e96449e03). Read about it first and make sure you understand the idea well.
* Try adding a delay for every new number that's displayed.
