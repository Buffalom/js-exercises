# Unit Converter
## Basic
### Description
The goal is to be able to easily convert fahrenheit to celsius and the other way aroung.

### Tasks
1. Have two input fields labelled "Fahrenheit" and "Celsius" and a button next to each them.
2. When you enter a number into either one of the input fields and click the button next to it, the converted value should be filled into the other input field.
3. Only allow numbers. Show an error message if e.g. a string is entered.
* Make sure the functionality is properly implemented and does not have any bugs.
* Feel free to add additional functionality, improve the features you just made or make the style and feel of the features nicer.
  * E.g. automatically convert when the value has changed and not when the button is clicked.

## Advanced
*This part is based on the basic part above.*

### Description
Make the user able to choose what he wants to convert. E.g. meter to yard or kilometer to meter

### Tasks
1. Convert when the value has changed and not when the button is clicked.
2. Add the possibility to convert different units of distances.
* Try doing it with as few lines of code as possible.
* Maybe add the possibility to convert different kinds of units such as distance, weight, temperature... Make sure you cannot convert distance to weight, temperature to distance...

### Hint
~~To do it with fewer lines of code go step by step. Think about what you could make simpler and do that before you go about any other section.~~
~~Maybe try doing it with some kind of matrix.~~
